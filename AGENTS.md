# Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the AI-Tools project, its features, and its architecture.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Hierarchical Resource Management:** Resources are defined in `resources.yml` using a flexible, hierarchical tagging system (e.g., `tags: ["tools/data-management"]`).
*   **Automated README Generation:** The `README.md` is automatically generated by the `scripts/generate_readme.py` script.
*   **Dynamic Table of Contents:** The script creates a multi-level Table of Contents with clickable links for easy navigation.
*   **GitHub Integration:** The script automatically fetches and displays author and star counts for GitHub repositories.
*   **Continuous Integration:** A GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/toc.yml` automatically updates the `README.md` whenever `resources.yml` is modified.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

*   **`resources.yml`:** The single source of truth for all the resources. It uses a simple YAML format with a list of resources, each with a name, URL, description, and a list of hierarchical tags.
*   **`scripts/generate_readme.py`:** A Python script that reads `resources.yml`, builds a nested data structure based on the tags, fetches GitHub repository information, and generates a `README.md` with a Table of Contents and a detailed resource list.
*   **`.github/workflows/toc.yml`:** A GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of updating the `README.md` file. It is triggered on every push to the `main` branch that modifies `resources.yml`.
